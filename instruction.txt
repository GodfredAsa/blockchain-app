WALLETS, KEYS AND TRANSACTIONS 

==================   WALLETS  ===========================
Digital Wallet: Its a core aspect of cryptocurrency. It has the following fields 
- Balance: how much currency collected by an individual in the blockchain history. Think of it has currency at bank.
- Pair of KEYS: Private Key only wallet owner has access to this key and a Public key visible to everyone on the cryptocurrency network.
    * The private key allows individual to generate UNIQUE DIGITAL SIGNATURES for their transactions.
    * Public Key is used to verity signatures.
    * Public Address: for other individuals can send currencies to that wallet.

==================   TRANSACTIONS  ===========================
They are the objects that capture information behind the exchange of currency btn 2 individuals. It has II aspects
 - Input of the transaction:  Providing details of the original sender
    * input timestamp 
    * Balance: 1000
    * sender public key : 0xa98e
    * sender's address : 0xbbc2 
 - Output 
    * Amount (amount of currency the sender wishes to send ): 40
    * Address: 0xbar2
   NB: Another output is send to the sender determining amount remaining after performance a transaction. {amount: 960, address: 0xbbbc2}
   calculation based on new_balance = actual_balance - transaction_amount

==================   DIGITAL SIGNATURES  ===========================
Each individual who wants to record a transaction must stamp the transaction data with a unique digital signature.
The signature is based on the individual's 2 keys  thus the private key abd public key. The keys are unique strings of numbers. 
The user has ability to signs data by creating signature thats an encrypted hashed value. 
The hashed value is generated by a combination of private key and the actual data.
private key + data  = signature
Verification is done using the public key of the individual who signed the data. The public key is used to decrypt the signature and read the original data 
behind it.

GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY
- Adding digital Wallets
- Signatures and Verification
- creating transactions
